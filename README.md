Project 4 is based on Robotic Process Automation , user acceptance testing. The whole purpose was to test the excel data on a web application.

HOWE USER CAN USE THE PROJECT:

-The user has to navigate to the web application URL where they will create their login details , verify them and sign in.
- The automation will then fill in and test data for 'Customers' ,'Orders' 'Products' and 'Orders Details' automatically as if the user was inserting them manually.
- The user just has to select which table they want to create new records for , for example, if the user wants to create a new customer , they click on 'Customer'.
- When the records have been filled in , the user can then click on 'edit' if they want to update the record and save
- After each record has been CREATED , READ , UPDATED the automation wil then DELETE and update the EXCEL file to prove that the test was successful
